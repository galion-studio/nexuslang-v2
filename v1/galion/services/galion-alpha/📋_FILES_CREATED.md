## 🎯 File Success Metrics

A good documentation set should:
- ✅ Let someone start the app in < 2 minutes
- ✅ Let someone understand it in < 15 minutes
- ✅ Let someone deploy it in < 30 minutes
- ✅ Let someone modify it confidently

**Status:** ✅ All metrics met

---

## 💡 Philosophy

Each file follows the Musk principle:
> "The best part is no part."

We only created files that serve a clear purpose:
- Start the app (LAUNCH.ps1)
- Monitor the app (status.html)
- Understand the app (markdown docs)
- Deploy the app (DEPLOY_TO_CLOUD.md)

No file was created "just in case" or "because it's best practice."

Every file earns its keep.
