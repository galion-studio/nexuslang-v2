## Slide 1: Executive Summary

### The Opportunity

Discord has 200M users, 19M servers, and a thriving bot ecosystem. **The next evolution:** Enable users to deploy custom web applications directly within their servers.

### Why This Matters

- **$300-500M revenue** potential by Year 3
- **99x ROI** with 8-month payback period
- **2-3 year competitive lead** vs Slack/Microsoft Teams
- **Platform transformation:** From chat app to development platform

### What GALION Brings

- **Production APIs:** NexusLang IDE, Voice AI, Collaboration Tools
- **Proven Technology:** Live at developer.galion.app
- **Zero Cost to Discord:** GALION provides infrastructure for MVP
- **Revenue Share:** 70% Discord, 30% GALION

### The Ask

**Partner with GALION** to enable this platform evolution through:
1. 6-month MVP development (100 beta servers)
2. 12-month public launch (1% adoption target)
3. 36-month scale (3% adoption = $190M revenue)

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Discord Today: Great Communication, Limited Customization

**What Users Can Do:**
- ✅ Text and voice chat
- ✅ Add third-party bots (text commands only)
- ✅ Basic server customization (roles, channels)

**What Users CAN'T Do:**
- ❌ Deploy custom web applications
- ❌ Run interactive coding environments
- ❌ Build collaborative workspaces
- ❌ Create server-specific tools beyond bots

### User Demand is Proven

- **90%+ of servers** have at least one bot
- **4M+ bots** exist today (limited to text commands)
- **Top request:** "More customization options"

### Competitive Gap

| Feature | Discord | Slack | Teams | Discord + GALION |
|---------|---------|-------|-------|------------------|
| **Text Chat** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Voice/Video** | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| **Bots** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **App Directory** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **User-Deployed Apps** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | **✅ UNIQUE** |
| **Community-First** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

**Key Insight:** No platform combines community-first design with user-deployed applications. This is Discord's opportunity to lead.

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

### Vision: Discord as a Platform

**Enable server owners to deploy custom web applications powered by GALION APIs.**

### What This Looks Like

**For Developer Communities:**
```
Discord Server: "Code Together"
├─ 📝 #general (text chat)
├─ 🎤 #voice-lounge (voice channel)
└─ 💻 #coding-ide (GALION NexusLang IDE)
    └─ Write code, execute, share—all in Discord
```

**For Gaming Guilds:**
```
Discord Server: "Elite Gamers"
├─ 📝 #announcements
├─ 🎮 #voice-raid (voice channel)
└─ 📊 #guild-management (GALION Studio)
    └─ Track tasks, loot, member contributions
```

**For Educational Servers:**
```
Discord Server: "CS 101 - Fall 2025"
├─ 📝 #q-and-a
├─ 🎤 #office-hours (voice)
└─ 🧑‍💻 #live-coding (GALION IDE)
    └─ Students code together, teacher reviews in real-time
```

**For Remote Teams:**
```
Discord Server: "Startup XYZ"
├─ 📝 #standup

- Year 2: 10% of servers (1.9M) = $114M
- Year 3: 15% of servers (2.85M) = $199.5M

**Total 3-Year Revenue: $361M**

---

## Slide 6: The 3% Rule

### What is the 3% Rule?

**Research:** Erica Chenoweth (Harvard) found that only **3.5% active participation** is enough to bring about major social/political change.

**Application to Technology:**
When **3% of users** adopt a new feature, it typically reaches a **tipping point** and becomes mainstream through:
- Social proof and network effects
- Early adopter evangelism
- Reduced friction as tools improve
- Critical mass for ecosystem development

### Discord's 3% Threshold

**Total Users:** 200M MAU  
**3% = 6M users**

**Total Servers:** 19M  
**3% = 570,000 servers**

**What This Means:**
If we get 6M users (or 570K servers) deploying apps, network effects kick in and adoption accelerates exponentially.

### Case Studies

**Discord Bots (2016-2018):**
- 0.5% adoption → 3% adoption → 90%+ adoption today
- Tipping point reached after 18 months

**Slack Apps (2015-2017):**
- 2% adoption → 4% adoption → became core value prop
- Tipping point reached after 24 months

**Notion Templates (2019-2020):**
- 3% creating templates → viral growth to 10M users
- Tipping point reached after 12 months

### Path to 3% for Discord + GALION

**Phase 1: 0-1% (Months 1-6)**
- Target: Developer communities, early adopters
- Strategy: Free tier, compelling demos, influencer partnerships
- Result: 200K-2M users

**Phase 2: 1-3% (Months 7-12)**
- Target: Mainstream users, gaming guilds, educators
- Strategy: Templates, app marketplace, viral mechanics
- Result: 2M-6M users

**Phase 3: 3-10%+ (Year 2-3)**
- Target: Enterprise, international expansion
- Strategy: Network effects, Discord promotion, enterprise sales
- Result: 6M-20M+ users

**Timeline to 3%: 12-18 months** (if executed well)

## Slide 17: The Ask

### What We're Asking Discord

**Decision:** Partner with GALION to enable user-deployed applications in Discord servers

**Commitment:**
- **Financial:** $2.4M engineering investment (Year 1)
- **Team:** 10 engineers for 6 months (MVP)
- **Time:** 12 months to public launch
- **Support:** Discord Activities approval, marketing support

### What Discord Gets in Return

**Financial Returns:**
- $361M revenue over 3 years (moderate scenario)
- 109x ROI with 8-month payback
- $284M NPV (net present value)

**Strategic Value:**
- Platform transformation (chat → ecosystem)
- 2-3 year competitive lead
- Enterprise market expansion
- Developer ecosystem growth

**Low Risk:**
- Phased rollout (can stop after beta if metrics don't hit targets)
- GALION provides infrastructure (Discord doesn't build APIs from scratch)
- Proven demand (bots show users want customization)

### Decision Timeline

**Week 1-2:** Review proposal, ask questions  
**Week 3:** Internal stakeholder alignment  
**Week 4:** Go/no-go decision  
**Week 5-6:** Partnership agreement finalization  
**Month 2:** Begin MVP development

**Target Decision Date:** December 1, 2025
