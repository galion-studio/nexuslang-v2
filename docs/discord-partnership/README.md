## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why partner with GALION vs building in-house?
**A:** GALION provides production-ready APIs (developer.galion.app live), saving Discord 18-24 months of development time. Focus Discord engineering on integration, not building APIs from scratch.

### Q: What if users don't adopt?
**A:** Phased rollout allows course correction. Beta with 100 servers (Month 6) validates demand before scaling. Risk-adjusted ROI still 75x.

### Q: How long to launch?
**A:** 6 months to beta (100 servers), 12 months to public launch (1,000 servers).

### Q: What about security?
**A:** All code runs in sandboxed Docker containers with rate limiting, encryption, and OAuth 2.0. External security audit recommended before launch.

### Q: Can we stop if it doesn't work?
**A:** Yes. Partnership has decision gates at Day 30, 60, and 90. Can pause/terminate with 90-day notice.
