## 📝 GITHUB STATUS

**Current Situation:**
- Latest code committed locally
- Old commits in history contain API key
- GitHub blocking push (security protection - good!)

**Your Options:**

**OPTION 1: Deploy Without GitHub (FASTEST)**
✅ Use your custom upload process to push code to RunPod
✅ Deploy directly on RunPod
✅ Skip GitHub for now
✅ **Time: 20 minutes to live**

**OPTION 2: Allow Secret in GitHub**
1. Visit: https://github.com/galion-studio/nexuslang-v2/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/35NpvikpPDMGmuRw65mjq5l7Oz5
2. Click "Allow secret" (repo is private, safe)
3. Push: `git push origin main`
4. Deploy from GitHub
✅ **Time: 25 minutes to live**

**RECOMMENDATION**: Use OPTION 1 (deploy directly) to go live NOW.  
Fix git history later with clean public repo.

---

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT COMMAND (Copy-Paste)

**On RunPod (via SSH):**

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /workspace/project-nexus

# If using GitHub (after allowing secret):
git pull origin main

# Make script executable
chmod +x deploy-everything-automated.sh

# Run full automation
./deploy-everything-automated.sh
```

**Script will prompt for:**
1. **OpenRouter API Key** (primary)
   - Get from: https://openrouter.ai/keys
   - Sign up → Create Key → Copy
   - Provides 30+ models including Claude, GPT-4, Llama

2. **Cloudflare API Token**
   - Get from: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
   - Create Token → Edit zone DNS → Include galion.app

3. **Cloudflare Zone ID**
   - Dashboard → galion.app → Overview → Zone ID (right side)

**Then script automatically:**
- ✅ Generates secure environment (JWT secrets, passwords)
- ✅ Builds all Docker images
- ✅ Starts all services (backend, frontend, database, redis)
- ✅ Configures Cloudflare DNS via API
- ✅ Sets SSL to Full (strict)
- ✅ Verifies deployment
- ✅ Reports success

**Result**: Live at developer.galion.app in 20 minutes!
