## 🔧 MANAGEMENT COMMANDS

### On RunPod

**Check status:**
```bash
# View running services
ps aux | grep -E "http.server|uvicorn"

# Test locally
curl http://localhost:3100
curl http://localhost:8100/health
```

**Restart services:**
```bash
# Kill and restart
pkill -f "http.server 3100"
pkill -f "uvicorn"

cd /workspace/nexuslang-frontend
python3 -m http.server 3100 &

cd /workspace/nexuslang-backend
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8100 &
```

**View logs:**
```bash
# Check for errors
tail -f /workspace/nexuslang-frontend/frontend.log
tail -f /workspace/nexuslang-backend/backend.log
```

---

## 📊 RESOURCE MONITORING

**Check RunPod usage:**
```bash
# CPU and memory
top

# Disk space
df -h

# Network
netstat -tlnp
```

**Expected usage:**
- CPU: 10-20%
- Memory: 2-3GB

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

### Alpha Goals (First Month)

**Target Metrics:**
- [ ] 50-100 user signups
- [ ] 500+ code executions
- [ ] 100+ projects created
- [ ] 10+ pieces of feedback
- [ ] 5+ bug reports (means people are using it!)

**Monitor:**
- Daily active users
- Code execution count
- Average session time
- Feature usage (personality, binary compile)

### Quality Metrics

- [ ] >99% uptime
- [ ] <100ms API response time
- [ ] <1% error rate

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

**Current Limitations:**
1. Voice system uses stubs (not real TTS/STT yet)
2. Knowledge base has demo data only
3. Binary files can compile but not execute yet
4. No real-time collaboration yet

**These are expected for Alpha!** Users know it's early access.
