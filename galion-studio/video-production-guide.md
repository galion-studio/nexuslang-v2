"Hey everyone! Welcome back to Galion Studio's live programming session!

Today we're building a voice-controlled task manager using our Galion Platform. No mouse, no keyboard - just voice commands and AI assistance.

If you're new here, I'm [Host Name], and I build the future of programming through voice-first development.

Give me a shoutout in the chat if you can hear me, and let's see what we can build together!
