## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: No Response from Discord (Days 1-14)

**Mitigation:**
- Multi-channel outreach (email, LinkedIn, Twitter)
- Warm introductions from mutual connections
- Engage with Discord's content (comment on blog posts, tweets)
- Attend Discord community events or conferences

**Backup Plan:**

---

### Risk 2: Technical Blockers (Days 31-60)

**Mitigation:**
- Build proof-of-concept early (Day 41-44)
- Identify blockers quickly and escalate
- Have backup architectures ready (e.g., Discord Activities instead of iframe)

**Backup Plan:**
- If iframe approach doesn't work, pivot to Discord Activities platform
- If Discord Activities not approved, use standalone web app with Discord login

---

### Risk 3: Beta Tester Recruitment Fails (Days 59-60)

**Mitigation:**
- Start recruitment early (Day 30)
- Offer incentives (free pro tier, early access, swag)
- Partner with Discord's community team for outreach

**Backup Plan:**
