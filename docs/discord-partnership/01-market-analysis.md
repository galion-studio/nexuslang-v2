## The 3% Rule Explained

### What is the 3% Rule?

**Research by Erica Chenoweth (Harvard):** Only 3.5% of a population actively participating in sustained campaigns is enough to bring about major political or social change.

**Application to Technology Adoption:**
When 3-5% of users adopt a new behavior or feature, it typically reaches a "tipping point" and becomes mainstream through:
- Social proof and network effects
- Early adopter evangelism
- Reduced friction as tools improve
- Critical mass for ecosystem development

### The 3% Rule for Discord

**Discord Statistics (2025):**
- **Total Users:** 200 million monthly active users
- **3% Threshold:** 6 million users
- **Active Servers:** 19 million servers
- **3% Threshold:** 570,000 servers

**What This Means:**
If **6 million users** (or **570,000 servers**) deploy custom applications using GALION APIs:
- Network effects kick in (users demand features from other servers)
- Developers create tools that spread virally
- Discord becomes synonymous with "programmable communities"
- Competitive moat against Slack and Teams

### Case Studies: 3% Rule in Action

#### 1. Discord Bots (2016-2018)
- **Initial Adoption:** ~500K users (~0.5% of 100M user base)
- **Tipping Point:** 3M users (~3% of 100M base)
- **Result:** Bots became mainstream, 90%+ servers have bots today

#### 2. Slack Apps (2015-2017)
- **Initial Adoption:** ~200K DAU using apps (~2% of 10M base)
- **Tipping Point:** ~400K DAU (~4% of 10M base)
- **Result:** Slack App Directory became core value proposition

#### 3. Notion Templates (2019-2020)
- **Initial Adoption:** ~100K users creating/sharing templates (~3% of 4M base)
- **Tipping Point:** Viral growth to 10M users by 2021
- **Result:** Templates ecosystem became Notion's competitive advantage

### How to Reach 3% with GALION + Discord

**Phase 1: Early Adopters (0-1% → 200K-2M users)**
- Target developer communities already on Discord
- Free tier with generous API limits
- Showcase compelling use cases (AI bots, collaborative IDEs, project management)
- Partner with influential Discord servers (gaming guilds, dev communities)

**Phase 2: Bridge to Mainstream (1-3% → 2M-6M users)**
- User-generated content (templates, app marketplace)
- Social proof (featured servers, case studies)
- Reduced friction (no-code app builders, templates)
- Viral mechanics (invite campaigns, referral bonuses)

**Phase 3: Tipping Point (3-10% → 6M-20M users)**
- Network effects take over
- Discord actively promotes platform
- Enterprise adoption begins
- International expansion

**Timeline:** 12-18 months to reach 3% if executed well
