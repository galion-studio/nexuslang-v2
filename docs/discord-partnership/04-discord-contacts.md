## Best Practices for Outreach

### Do's

- ✅ Include concrete data: user engagement, revenue opportunity
- ✅ Offer specific next steps: demo, pilot program, API documentation
- ✅ Keep initial email under 200 words
- ✅ Follow up after 7-10 days if no response

### Don'ts
- ❌ Don't mass email everyone at once
- ❌ Don't overhype or make unrealistic claims
- ❌ Don't send long attachments without context
- ❌ Don't be overly salesy or pushy
- ❌ Don't ignore Discord's existing platform constraints
- ❌ Don't propose features that compete with Discord's core business
